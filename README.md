# MYProjects
 -Improved Credit Card Fraud Detection Performance Using Ensembles in Machine Learning Algorithms

# Overview
-This is a readme detailing the process of cleaning and investigating prediction output using different algorithms on  Credit Card Fraud dataset. 
-The purpose of this project is to improve credit card fraud prediction 

Timeframe of the study: 2015 - 2017
# Resources and tools used
- Dataset is gotten from Kaggle
# Data Transformation 
- Null value was removed
- heat map plotted to show correlation
- data visualized using  scatter plot. observation of  outliers.
- further transformed dataset using selectkbest 
- Smothe approach to reduce the imbalanced nature of the dataset. 
- standard scaler to scale the dataset
# TestTrain
- Dataset is split and trained using machine learning algorithms
- dataset is tested and prediction occurs. 
- Various parameters like precision, f1-score, recall, specificity, sensitivity, accuracy, and MSE are used for comparative analysis
- The result is tried to improve using ensembles
# Conclusion
- With MSE smaller than 0.0011, both training and testing datasets achieved more than 99 percent accuracy.
- The end result proved that Adaboost and Voting classifiers showed improved accuracy than some other methods.
